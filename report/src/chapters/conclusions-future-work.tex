\section{Conclusions and future work.}
We have surveyed the problem of computing Kronecker's canonical form of an arbitrary pencil of matrices, which has
applications in calculating the solutions for differential-algebraic equations, and made use of SageMath's \cite{sage}
support for symbolic computations to implement an algorithm to compute such canonical form. It is also important
to emphasize how such a procedure was not publicly available before.

Defining a procedure to calculate the matrices needed to transform a matrix pair to its Kronecker's canonical form,
we have proved theorem \ref{thm:kcf} (\nameref{thm:kcf}) and shown an algorithm for it in
algorithm \ref{alg:kcf} (\nameref{alg:kcf}).

The result is a software implementation of this very same procedure \cite{trapani-kronecker},
which has been tested to a sufficient degree to ensure it is properly working.

Despite what has been accomplished, more work can be done on optimizations. A direction for future work
would include redefining the method used to compute the polynomial of minimal degree \(\epsilon\) in the right kernel of
the pencil of matrices in input; every iteration, it builds an \(M_\epsilon\) matrix (refer to chapter
\textbf{Computation of Kronecker's Canonical Form}) and computes from scratch its right kernel.

We can see how the work required to put an \(M_{\epsilon}^{(A, B)}\) matrix in echelon form partially
overlaps with that needed for an \(M_{\epsilon-1}^{(A, B)}\) matrix as the equations solved by the two polynomials
\(g(\lambda)\), \(p(\lambda)\) calculated from these two matrices are
\begin{align*}
    Ag_{0} &= 0, &
    Bg_{0} - Ag_{1} &= 0, &
    & ..., &
    Bg_{\epsilon-1} - Ag_{\epsilon} &= 0, &
    Bg_{\epsilon} &= 0 \text{ and} \\
    Ap_{0} &= 0, &
    Bp_{0} - Ap_{1} &= 0, &
    & ..., &
    Bp_{\epsilon-2} - Ap_{\epsilon-1} &= 0, &
    Bp_{\epsilon-1} &= 0.
\end{align*}
