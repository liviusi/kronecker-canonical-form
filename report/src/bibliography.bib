abstract = {The benefits of using computer algebra systems (CAS) in teaching, mainly at undergraduate level, have been discussed by many authors, but they do not, in general, highlight the problems and difficulties which can occur. This paper identifies some of the difficulties and argues that although it is advantageous to use CAS in many cases, they must always be used with thought. Furthermore, the user should be aware of pitfalls and limitations, at any mathematical level. As a result of taking due care and attention, the benefits of CAS will be enhanced.}

author = {Th. Beelen and P. {Van Dooren}},
abstract = {We give an O(m2n) algorithm for computing the Kronecker structure of an arbitrary m×n pencil λE−A. The algorithm is shown to be numerically stable, because only unitary transformations are used. The improved speed over earlier unitary methods is due to the efficient use of condensed forms which are maintained throughout the recursions of the algorithm.}
