abstract = {The benefits of using computer algebra systems (CAS) in teaching, mainly at undergraduate level, have been discussed by many authors, but they do not, in general, highlight the problems and difficulties which can occur. This paper identifies some of the difficulties and argues that although it is advantageous to use CAS in many cases, they must always be used with thought. Furthermore, the user should be aware of pitfalls and limitations, at any mathematical level. As a result of taking due care and attention, the benefits of CAS will be enhanced.}
